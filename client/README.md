This app is created with a JavaScript frontend using the ReactJS Library. 

With React, I am using the useEffect and useState to assist with any changes in state as well as passing props from parent components to child components. 

With React-Router-Dom, I am using the Route hooks to help with navigation.

To interact with a server, I am using Ruby and Ruby on Rails with full CRUD functionality. 

I am using Model-View-Controller design to handle router requests, validations, authentications, relational associations, sessions and tokens for users to remain logged in if they leave the page. 

I have created default data in the seeds.rb for initialization. Along with a schema file that shows the created the database / tables. 

In this app, a user has an ability to sign into their account, or, create an account if they do not have one. They are required to use a password to login. 

Each user has one profile that they are able to create and update. 

Each user can add multiple songs. 

A user is able to update, delete, or read a list of songs belonging to them. 

A user is able to view a list of songs that have been shared by all other users and favorite songs that they like. 

If the user favorites songs, they are able to navigate to another page with only their favorited songs showing. 

A user is able to leave the app and return and find that they are still signed in. The user is also able to log themselves out. 

To demo without creating an account, you can use
